  <i>Open Android Backup Companion</i> is the Android companion app, giving the backup script access to data otherwise not available to ADB. <i>Open Android Backup</i> is a tiny shell script & Flutter app that makes securely backing up Android devices easy, without vendor lock-ins or using closed-source software that could put your data at risk. It's based on ADB but doesn't use the deprecated adb backup command.
